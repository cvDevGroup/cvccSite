[Andrew Kirchman]({{< relref "/speakers/andrewK" >}})

Andrew Kirchman is a lead software engineer at Thomson Reuters who brings over a decade of resume review and hiring experience. Through this talk, we’ll learn from others’ mistakes in their resumes, and how to best craft a resume to improve your hiring chances.

With over one thousand resumes reviewed, and having conducted dozens of hiring interviews, Andrew brings a wealth of first hand experience in terms of what things recruiters would like to see on resumes…and what to avoid. Through a humorous look at “wait, did they really just submit their resume like this?” events, we’ll look at some of the good, the bad, and the ugly of resumes Andrew has seen - and how to help get your resume to the best it can be. The primary focus of the talk will be on resume creation, as that is often the first impression you make, but we’ll also touch briefly on other aspects of the hiring process.
