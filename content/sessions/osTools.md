You probably already use Markdown to create content, but you can supercharge your content workflow with additional tools that let you create technically correct and consistent content your fellow developers will love.

Ensure code samples work by pulling them in from your Git repositories. Enforce your style using style guides you borrow or create, complete with guidance right in your text editor. And then convert your content to whatever format you need.  

In this talk you'll see how to lint content with Vale, inject code into your documentation with SnipSync, and use Pandoc to build books. All these tools are open source and free. Get ready to take your content to the next level.
