Calling all Speakers and Presenters to submit a presentation ~~on papercall~~ via email to [cfp@cvdevgroup.org](mailto:cfp@cvdevgroup.org?subject=Submission&body=Talk%20Title%3A%0A%0AElevator%20Pitch%3A%20Two%20sentences%20to%20sell%20your%20talk.%0A%0AFormat%2C%20Choose%20One%3A%20Regular%20(~40%20min)%20%2F%20Lightning%20(~5%20min)%20%2F%20Workshop%20(%3Ehour).%0A%0AAudience%20Level%3A%20Beginner%20%2F%20Intermediate%20%2F%20Advanced%0A%0ADescription%20(Markdown%20Preferred)%3A%0A%0ANotes%20(informational%20only%2C%20not%20published)%3A%0A%0ASpeaker%20Name%3A%0A%0ASpeaker%20URL%3A%0A%0AShirt%20Size%3A%0A%0ASpeaker%20Bio%3A)!

Without presenters, a conference is just a bunch of nerds milling about without any central topics to discuss and learn about - it falls flat. 

If you're curious about presenting but are unsure, come talk to us on [Slack](https://bit.ly/cvdevgroup-slack-invite) or email [codecamp@cvdevgroup.org](mailto:codecamp@cvdevgroup.org) and we'll sort it out!

The CFP Formally closes on Feb 19th, 2026.
