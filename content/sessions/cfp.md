Calling all Speakers and Presenters to submit a presentation [on papercall](https://papercall.io/cvcc2026)!

Without presenters, a conference is just a bunch of nerds milling about without any central topics to discuss and learn about - it falls flat. 

If you're curious about presenting but are unsure, come talk to us on [Slack](https://bit.ly/cvdevgroup-slack-invite) or email [codecamp@cvdevgroup.org](mailto:codecamp@cvdevgroup.org) and we'll sort it out!

The CFP Formally closes on Feb 28th, 2026.
