## Success On Your Own Terms

Are you ready to level up your career, but the only path you see is to become management? Let me show you another way. I’ve been a code-monkey. I’ve worked in the cubical mazes of “bigcorp”. I got out, and it was the scariest thing I ever did—and the best thing that ever happened to me.

Let me give you a roadmap. You’ll learn about freelancing, consulting, and starting businesses, and be able to spot the roadblocks that will get in your way. I hope to give you the confidence to step outside your comfort zone and go for it. There will never be a better time.
