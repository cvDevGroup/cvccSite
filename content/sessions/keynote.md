## Success On Your Own Terms
[Todd H. Gardner]({{< relref "/speakers/todd" >}})


Are you ready to level up your career, but the only path you see is to become management? Let me show you another way. I’ve been a code-monkey. I’ve worked in the cubical mazes of “bigcorp”. I got out, and it was the scariest thing I ever did—and the best thing that ever happened to me.

Let me give you a roadmap. You’ll learn about freelancing, consulting, and starting businesses, and be able to spot the roadblocks that will get in your way. I hope to give you the confidence to step outside your comfort zone and go for it. There will never be a better time.
