            <h2>Build Large Language Models from 0 to 60 (Llama, GPT, OpenAI)</h2>
            <p>Everyone is talking about AI, and using tools from OpenAI such as ChatGPT. Want to know what
                it takes to build your own Large Language Models(LLMs)? We will explore the tools ranging
                from hardware requirements to software requirements. We'll discuss the key elements of
                language model design, including tokenization strategies, neural network architectures, and
                training techniques. Attention will be drawn to the significance of quality training data,
                exploring techniques for data collection, cleaning, and augmentation. This presentation,
                suitable for ML enthusiasts, data scientists, and curious individuals, promises a
                comprehensive understanding of constructing large language models, marking the pathway from
                zero knowledge to a functional model.</p>
