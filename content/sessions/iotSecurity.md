IoT devices offer an opportunity to expand and enhance existing networks but also introduce new security vulnerabilities. This session will explore various types of IoT devices and networks, along with the associated security challenges they present and the potential risks to network integrity.

As the adoption of IoT devices continues to rise in both personal and business contexts, it is essential to prioritize security when integrating these technologies. While numerous Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices connect via standard Wi-Fi or Bluetooth networks, this session will focus on two protocols designed for IoT: MQTT and LoRaWAN. The presentation will conclude with an examination of the security challenges associated with these technologies and strategies for mitigating vulnerabilities within the network.
