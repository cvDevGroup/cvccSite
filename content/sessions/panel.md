### What is an IT EDUCATION DEATHMATCH?!
It's kind of like a regular panel, but more fun: 
- When questions are asked, we'll have them up on a projector behind the panelists, including fun graphics with fire and swords.
- After each round of questions, your gameshow host will award points to the best answer - decided arbitrarily, and awarded an arbitrary amount of points.
- Moderators will accept questions from the audience, time permitting.
- A winner will be crowned!
