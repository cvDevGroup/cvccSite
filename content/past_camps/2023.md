On Saturday, December 2nd, 2023, professionals and students alike gathered at beautiful Chippewa Valley Technical College to engage in a full day of learning, networking, and comradery.

The day kicked off with a keynote by Zach Halmstad, Eau Claire's celebrity entrepreneur and co-founder of Jamf Software!

We had two concurrent tracks with presenations ranging from C++ testing and Arduino coding for commercial products, to cloud software services and neural networks. There was also a morning-long workshop for hands-on web development with Golang. We even had a panel of AI industry experts. There was something for everyone.
