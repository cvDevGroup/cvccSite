On Saturday, December 2nd, 2023, professionals and students alike gathered at beautiful Chippewa Valley Technical College to engage in a full day of learning, networking, and comradery.

The day kicked off with a keynote by Zach Halmstad, Eau Claire's celebrity entrepreneur and co-founder of Jamf Software!

All in all, we had a total of 95 folks participate at the event. Free sandwiches helped open conversation with current and potential friends who share similar interests.

We had two concurrent tracks with presenations ranging from C++ testing and Arduino coding for commercial products, to cloud software services and neural networks. There was also a morning-long workshop for hands-on web development with Golang. We even had a panel of AI industry experts. There was something for everyone.
