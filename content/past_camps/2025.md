Chippewa Valley Code Camp 2025 was held on Saturday, March 15th. The theme for the conference was tech entrepreneurship.

After our keynote speaker [Todd Gardner](/speakers/todd/) was introduced with a comedic icebreaker, he regailed us with his journey as an entrepreneur. He included insights into realizing commercially-viable software products. The keynote was personal and relatable!

Presentations are the meat of any tech conference. Ranging from soft skills like [resume writing](/sessions/resumetales/), to technical implementation of useful [open source platforms](/sessions/rustrabbit/), we were able to schedule content to benefit everyone!

In addition to six scheduled presentations, the conference was bolstered with a hands-on [workshop](/sessions/moderngo/), and a panel on [tech entrepreneurship](/sessions/panel/).

We were able to provide a great lunch, as well as a t-shirt giveaway & 3d-printed conference SWAG. Not bad for a conference that's [free to attend](/sponsors/2025/)!

After we wrapped up the main conference, we met for beverages. Hope to see everyone again next year.

Cheers! -Dan
