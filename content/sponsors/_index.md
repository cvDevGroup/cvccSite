### Why Sponsor?

For many CVCC attendees, programming and information systems aren't just a vocation, but a passion. There's **no better event** in Northern Wisconsin to build relationships with talented IT professionals.

### Sponsorship Goals

The event is free to attend, so all of our costs are met by sponsors. Here are some items that still need to be covered in order of cost and impact on the event.

- Organization fees and event insurance
- ~~Coffee~~
- ~~Breakfast~~
- ~~Lunch~~
- SWAG
- Afterparty
- T-shirts
- A/V Equipment (For recording presentations)
