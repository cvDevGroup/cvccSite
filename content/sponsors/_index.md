### Why Sponsor?

For many CVCC attendees, programming and information systems aren't just a vocation, but a passion. There's **no better event** in Northern Wisconsin to build relationships with talented IT professionals.

### Sponsorship Goals

The event is free to attend, so all of our costs are met by sponsors. Here are some items, and their costs that your sponsorship will cover.

- Organization fees and event insurance
- Coffee
- Breakfast
- Lunch
- Speaker Swag
- Afterparty
- T-shirts
- A/V Equipment (For recording presentations)
