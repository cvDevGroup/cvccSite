I currently teach Automation Engineering Technology at CVTC. Prior to my teaching career, I gained experience as an Electrical Engineer and Programmer/Analyst. I am a graduate of the Computer and Electrical Engineering program at UW-Stout, where I contributed to research projects focused on IIoT and autonomous systems. Throughout my career, I have worked on a diverse range of projects, from web applications to embedded systems. I take great pleasure in sharing my knowledge with others, as it also helps deepen my own understanding of the topics.
