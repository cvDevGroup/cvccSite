## CFP is OPEN!

Calling all Speakers and Presenters to submit a presentation [here](https://papercall.io/cvcc2025)!

Without presenters, a conference is just a bunch of nerds milling about without any central topics to discuss and learn about - it falls flat. 

If you're curious about presenting but are unsure, come talk to us on [Slack](https://bit.ly/cvdevgroup-slack-invite) and we'll sort it out!

The CFP Formally closes on Feb 1st, 2025.

### Presentation FAQ:

#### Speaker Qualifications

- What education level is required?
    - N/A
- What if I don't have formal training?
    - That makes for some of the best presentations
- What if I'm nervous?
    - Everyone gets nervous!

#### Choosing a Topic
- How do I know if anyone is interested in my topic?
    - If it's something that excites you, others will appreciate it.
    - If the topic doesn't excite you... maybe pick something that does.
- Is my topic appropriate for the audience?
    - If you have doubts, [submit](https://papercall.io/cvcc2025) a rough idea, we can help you workshop it!
- I don't know enough about the topic
    - "The best way to learn is to teach" - _Frank Oppenheimer_
