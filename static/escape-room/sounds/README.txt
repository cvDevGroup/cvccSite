SOUNDS DIRECTORY
================

Place the following audio files here:

  beep.mp3     — Short UI confirmation beep (used on button presses, key accepted, etc.)
  success.mp3  — Victory fanfare (played on win screen)
  alarm.mp3    — Alert/klaxon sound (played when lockdown triggers and on fail screen)

These are optional. If the files are missing, the game continues silently.
Audio can be globally disabled by setting AUDIO_ENABLED: false in config.js.

Recommended formats: MP3 for broadest browser support.
Keep files small (< 200 KB each) for fast loading.
